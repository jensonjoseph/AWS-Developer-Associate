Identity And Access Management.

Allows you to manage users and their level of access to AWS console. 
	Centralized control of AWS account. 
	Shared access to AWS account. create users and groups and allow or deny access to AWS resources.
	Granular permissions. 
	Identity federation (use credentials stored in linkedin, fb..)
	Multi factor authentication (e.g username password and then token)
	Temporary access to users/devices and services as necessary. 
	Setup own password rotation policy. 

	IAM is universal and does not apply to region. 
	New users have no permissions when they are first created. 
	Users are assigned Access Key ID and secret access key ID when first created. 
	These are not same as password and cannot be used to login to management console. 
	However, these can be used to access AWS via API and CLI.
